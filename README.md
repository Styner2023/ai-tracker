# Indeed AI Trackers

The Indeed AI Tracker developed by Hiring Lab monitors the share of job postings containing AI-related terms over time. The data are seven-day trailing averages. For more information see [here](https://www.hiringlab.org/2023/09/21/indeed-ai-jobs-tracker/).

We currently cover the following countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, UK, Ireland, Singapore, US. 

We expect to update these AI trackers at a regular cadence, with our initial target being roughly monthly.  The exact update schedule is subject to team capacity and priorities.
